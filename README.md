# Pygmy hippo modelling Gola, Sierra Leone

Pygmy hippos are elusive and rare forest mammals of conservation concern that occur in the Greater Gola Landscape, Sierra Leone. 
Unfortunately, limited knowledge exists on distribution of pygmy hippos across Gola, the drivers of occurence as well as changes in occurence over time. 
Several conservation projects focusing on the conservation of pygmy hippos have been carried out which mostly included some monitoring. 
Consequently, a wealth of pygmy hippo monitoring data exists, but the data has no common survey plots or schemes. However, data can roughly be split into transect surveys and camera trap surveys. 

We apply a static multi season integrated occupancy model which integrates both camera trapping and riverine transect survey data via a common ecological model part while accounting for imperfect detection for each of the two sampling types. 
Since knowlege on drivers of pygmy hippo occupancy is rather limited and more sophisticated bayesian models with high computational burden could cause struggles for model selevtion, we apply a data driven approach to narrow down possible predictiors for the common ecological model part by employing a conditional random forest.
